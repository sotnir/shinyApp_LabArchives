## Workflow and Expected Logistics

<img src="img/scheduling-workflow.png" alt="Scheduling Workflow" width="100%"/>

Expected logistics are:

1. Constantly maintained calendar with most up-to-date availability
2. Minimal information
   - Title: De-identified participant ID (e.g. NENAH001, ROAR001)
   - Description: Hospital ID (e.g. Rhm1234567), participant initials (optional)
   - No PHI/PII. No participant full name, parentâ€™s full name, DOB, etc.
   - Type of scan: University Research, etc. (for report and auditing purposes, see demo)
3. All new reservations pending approval
4. Unused slots are released immediately so other studies may use
   - Scanning team reserves the right to remove slots that participant details are not provided timely
   - **Communicate closely between research/scanning team**
5. (For rescheduling) In principle, research team proposes new reservation
   - Research team shall deletes the existing one and make a new reservation
   - Research team shall shall not update the approved reservation to a new date
   - **But scanning team could help. Communicate closely between scanning/research team**
