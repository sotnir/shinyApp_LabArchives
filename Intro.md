## Overview

This interactive app serves as a tool to track and quantify the utility of university research slots on the 3T MRI, through creating diagrams based on the report from [LabArchives](https://sotnir-handbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/projects-soton/mri-scanner.html).

This app was developed and maintained by Dr Yukai Zou (Y.Zou@soton.ac.uk).

## Quickstart

<a name="How-to-1-sign-in"></a>
### 1. Sign In

You should already obtain an account and have access to the research MRI booking system:

 - Link: https://scheduler.labarchives.com/

Instructions for how to create an account can be accessed [here](https://sotnir-handbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/projects-soton/mri-scanner.html).

After signing in you may or may not view the calendar of research MRI slots immediately. If not, you will need to click on your name at the top right and select "Switch Organizations":

   - Type of scan: University Research, etc. (for report and auditing purposes, see demo)
3. All new reservations pending approval
4. Unused slots are released immediately so other studies may use
   - Scanning team reserves the right to remove slots that participant details are not provided timely
   - **Communicate closely between research/scanning team**
