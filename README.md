# UoS/UHS Research MRI Booking System

This github repository stores and manages the codes and descriptions of the shinyApp that generates diagrams of research utility for the MRI scanner at University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust, for report and auditing purposes.

For queries, please contact Dr Yukai Zou (Y.Zou@soton.ac.uk).

## Motivation

There needs to establish an SOP workflow for scheduling, report, and auditing, to monitor the use of the University's research slots. The report will be useful for Research Imaging Management Group and UoS/UHS finances. Such workflow needs to be as open and transparent for both UoS and UHS personnels as possible.

### Reporting frequency

Every 3 months.

| Date              | Status                      |
| ----------------- | --------------------------- |
| 31 December 2021  | Completed (View Report)     |
| 28 February 2022  | Completed (View Report)     |
| 31 May 2022       | Scheduled                   |
| 31 August 2022    | Scheduled                   |
| 30 November 2022  | Scheduled                   |

### Critical Control Points
 1. Increase/decrease of the slots used between report period
 2. UoS slots are used for UHS clinical scans and UHS R&D purposes
 3. Availability of research radiographer
