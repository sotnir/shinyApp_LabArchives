# UoS/UHS Research MRI Booking System

This is a github repository that stores and manages the codes and 
descriptions of the shinyApp that generates diagrams of research utility 
for the MRI scanner.

For queries, please contact Dr Yukai Zou (Y.Zou@soton.ac.uk).

To regularly monitor the use of the University's research slots. Reporting frequency is currently set at every 3 months. There needs to set up a standardised and intuititve manner of generating this report. The report will be useful for Research Imaging Management Group and UoS/UHS Finance offices.

### Key Elements
 - Increase/decrease of the slots used between report period
 - Availability of research radiographer
 - UoS slots are used for UHS clinical scans and UHS R&D purposes
